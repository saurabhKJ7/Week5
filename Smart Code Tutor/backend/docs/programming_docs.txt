Python Programming Language
=======================

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Basic Syntax:
- Indentation is used to define code blocks
- Variables don't need explicit declaration
- Dynamic typing allows flexible variable types
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are built-in data structures

Common Operations:
1. Print output: print("Hello, World!")
2. Variables: x = 42
3. Lists: my_list = [1, 2, 3]
4. Loops: for item in my_list:
5. Conditionals: if condition:

Error Handling:
- try/except blocks catch and handle exceptions
- Common exceptions: ValueError, TypeError, IndexError
- Best practice: catch specific exceptions

JavaScript Programming Language
============================

JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for web development. It runs in browsers and can be used server-side with Node.js.

Basic Syntax:
- Semicolons terminate statements (optional but recommended)
- Variables declared with let, const, or var
- Curly braces define code blocks
- Functions are first-class objects

Common Operations:
1. Print output: console.log("Hello, World!")
2. Variables: let x = 42;
3. Arrays: let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
4. Loops: for (let item of myArray) {}
5. Conditionals: if (condition) {}

Error Handling:
- try/catch blocks handle exceptions
- Common errors: TypeError, ReferenceError
- Promise rejections use .catch() method

Best Practices
============

Code Organization:
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Comment complex logic
- Follow language-specific style guides

Debugging Tips:
- Use print statements/console.logs
- Check variable types
- Validate input data
- Read error messages carefully

Performance:
- Avoid unnecessary loops
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider memory usage
- Profile code when needed
